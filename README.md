# Role manager contract

This project implements a simple Greeting contract that enables setting and retrieving a greeting message through a **role-based approach**, enforced by the RoleManager contract.

The Greeting contract extends the Ownable contract from the OpenZeppelin library, which provides ownership-related functionality, such as the onlyOwner modifier. It also has a reference to an instance of an **IRoleManager contract**, which is used to check if a wallet has access to perform certain actions on the Greeting contract. The onlyWalletWithAccess modifier is used to enforce this check and prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, it provides the hasRole function that allows checking if a given address has access to the Greeting contract.
